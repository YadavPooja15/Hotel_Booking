* Converting columns to appropriate data types
* Removing outliers
* Creating new columns

## Exploratory Data Analysis:-
### Performed EDA and tried answering the following questions:-
 * Which agent makes the most no. of bookings?
 * Which room type is in most demand and which room type generatesthe  highest adr?

## Analysis:-
 * Agent no. 9 has made most no. of bookings.
 * Most demanded room type is A, but better adr generating rooms H, G and C. Hotels should increase the no. of room types A and H to maximise revenue.
 * Most popular meal type is BB(Bed and Breakfast).
 * Around 60% bookings are for City hotel and 40% bookings are for Resort hotel, therefore City Hotel is busier than Resort hotel.
 * Guests use different channels for making bookings out of which most preferred way is TA/TO.
 * July- August are the most busier and profitable months for both of hotels.
 * Most of the guests came from european countries, with highest number of guests from Portugal.
 * Most common stay length is less than 4 days and generally people prefer City hotel for short stay, but for long stays, Resort Hotel is preferred.


## Challenges:-
 * There was a lot of duplicate data.
 * Data was present in wrong datatype format.
 * Choosing appropriate visualization techniques to use was difficult.
 * A lot of null values were there in the dataset.
