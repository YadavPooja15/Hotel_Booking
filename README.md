 3.) Most popular meal type is BB(Bed and Breakfast).
 4.) Around 60% bookings are for City hotel and 40% bookings are for Resort hotel, therefore City Hotel is busier than Resort hotel.
 5.) Guests use different channels for making bookings out of which most preferred way is TA/TO.
 6.) July- August are the most busier and profitable months for both of hotels. 
 7.) Most of the guests came from european countries, with highest number of guests from Portugal.
